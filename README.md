This project is an online food ordering platform built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The website offers a user-friendly interface where customers can explore a wide variety of food items, add them to their cart, and place orders with ease. The platform ensures the highest quality standards in food offerings, catering to diverse culinary preferences.
The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, efficiently manages user authentication, order processing, and interactions with the MongoDB database, which securely stores user profiles, menus, and order histories. The frontend leverages React.js combined with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create smooth, engaging, and dynamic animations, enhancing the overall user experience. With Stripe integration, the platform provides secure and reliable payment processing, giving users peace of mind during transactions.
This platform is designed to deliver not only a diverse and high-quality selection of food but also a reliable and enjoyable service, making it a comprehensive and dependable solution for online food ordering.
